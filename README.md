Abstractâ€”The use of reward-based optimization for the dialogue system
process through reinforcement learning is described in this paper.
Our strategy is to create a dialogue system where the task is to book
a movie ticket and further optimize the performance by simulating noise
in the dialogue system components to achieve the desired goal of the
user. Although this limitation can typically be managed in the context of
dialog systems with adequate monitoring changes in behavioral flow,
these errors may be noises in components such as Input from the
User, Natural Language Processing components that deal with their own
mistakes when understanding and manipulating user dialogues. In order
to achieve the user objective, we also focus on the dialog framework
that decides the appropriate policy given the dialogue state. These
strategies are generally framed as a task of reinforcement learning in
which the goal is to maximize the reward for those actions that result in
a successful conversation. In order to achieve better performance,
